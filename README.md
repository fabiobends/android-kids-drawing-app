# Kids Drawing App

Fourth project coded on "Complete Android 12 & Kotlin Development Masterclass"

I learned how to:

- handle `onDraw` and `onTouchEvent` on `View` to draw lines
- use `FrameLayout` to append two views, for instance `ImageView` and a custom view, in this case the one called `DrawingView`
- use `Dialog` to display an UI overlay on the screen and customize it
- handle permissions on Android such as: `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
- use `coroutine` to handle processing on a thread other than the UI one
- save files and share them

When I was taking this course, I was also reading "Clean Code" from Robert Martin, so I used some concepts seen in the book related to functions and meaningful names as well, making the code as much as possible readable, organized and expressive.
